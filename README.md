# Expense Categorization ML Pipeline

An automated machine learning pipeline for categorizing financial transactions using ensemble models and active learning. The system employs FLAML AutoML for model training and supports both local and cloud-based model storage with Google Cloud Storage integration.

## üåü Features

- Automated model training using FLAML AutoML
- Ensemble approach combining LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models
- Model versioning and registry system
- Google Cloud Storage integration for model backup
- Batch prediction capabilities with confidence scoring
- Performance monitoring and alerting system
- SHAP-based model interpretability
- Active learning workflow with human feedback incorporation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Google Cloud Storage account (optional)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up Google Cloud credentials (optional):
- Place your GCP service account JSON file in a secure location
- Update the `CREDENTIALS_PATH` in relevant configuration files

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Training Models

Run the automated model training pipeline:

```bash
python src/auto_model_ensemble.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess training data
- Train ensemble models using FLAML AutoML
- Generate SHAP explanations
- Save models locally and to GCS
- Update the model registry

### Batch Predictions

Process new transactions:

```bash
python src/batch_predict_ensemble.py
```

Features:
- Efficient batch processing
- Confidence scoring
- Performance monitoring
- Automated alerting for low-confidence predictions
